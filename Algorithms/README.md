# Algorithms Section

Welcome to the **Algorithms Section**!  
In this section, I will be implementing a variety of algorithms, such as sorting, searching, and more. The goal is to understand how these algorithms work, how I can modify them, and how to optimize their performance for better effectiveness.

## Currently Implemented
### Sorting algorithms
- [Bubble Sort](https://github.com/Kymelios/C_language_projects/tree/62ce70e80ffdebe7de908eedb8bdd75b5c3eff26/Algorithms/Bubble%20sort)
- [Selection Sort](https://github.com/Kymelios/C_language_projects/tree/77cd65b896429cccbc2cac5ab07554dd91247dd3/Algorithms/Selection%20sort)

### Search algorithms
- [Linear Search](https://github.com/Kymelios/C_language_projects/tree/44c7a24d5370f17164af813dfed8293800b3e283/Algorithms/Linear%20Search)

### Different algorithms
- [Find the Biggest Number in an Array](https://github.com/Kymelios/C_language_projects/tree/676d1af25015a50ce0e7ccf18539c995486fc825/Algorithms/Find%20max%20value%20algorithm)
