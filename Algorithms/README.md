# Algorithms Section

Welcome to the **Algorithms Section**!  
In this section, I will be implementing a variety of algorithms, such as sorting, searching, and more. The goal is to understand how these algorithms work, how I can modify them, and how to optimize their performance for better effectiveness.

## Currently Implemented

- [Bubble Sort](./bubble_sort.c)  
- [Find the Biggest(max) value in an Array](./find_max_value.c)
