# Algorithm That Finds the Largest Value in the Array

This code finds the largest number in the array. It has one function:  
1. **findMaxValue()** - iterates through the array and returns the largest value. 

## **Example Usage**  
Given the input array `{3, 1, 6, 9, 1, 124}`, the `findMaxValue()` function will iterate through each element in the array and return the largest value, which in this case is `124`.
```
Max value: 124
```
