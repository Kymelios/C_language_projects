# Linear Search Algorithm

This code implements the linear search algorithm. It has only one function:
1. **findIndex()** - This function searches for a target value in an array and returns its index if the value is found. If the value is not found, it returns `-1`.

## **Example Usage**
Given the input array `{-1, 4, 5, 6, 8}`, the `findIndex()` function iterates through all elements in the array. If it finds the target value, it will return its index. If it doesn't find the target value, it will return `-1`.
```
If we search for number -1: 
Element was found at index: 0

If we search for number 3: 
Element was not found!
```
