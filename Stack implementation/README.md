Stack Implementation in C

File stack.c contains a simple implementation of a stack data structure in C.
It has such commands:

1) push(): It adds an element to the top of the stack.
2) pop():  It removes the top element of the stack.
3) peek(): It outputs the top element of the stack.
4) createStack(): Initializes a new stack.
5) isStackFull/Empty(): Checks if the stack is full or empty and returns boolean value based on the result.
6) printStack(): This function prints all elements of the stack, starting from the topmost element and moving down to the bottom.
